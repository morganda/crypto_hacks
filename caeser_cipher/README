# Description
This is just an example implementation of the Caeser Cipher. The cipher picks
a rotation factor and rotates each letter by that factor. For example, if our
factor was 3 and we had the letter 'a', we could apply the cipher by adding 3
to 'a' to give us 'd'. If we applied it to a longer string like "cat", we
would get "fdw".
